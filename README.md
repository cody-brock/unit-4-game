# unit-4-game

This is my Star Wars RPG game.

HOW TO PLAY
Your first task is to choose your character - just choose any of the four available characters.

The characters will now move to their respective positions - the one you choose goes to "your character" and the ones you didn't choose will go to "enemies available to attack."

You can now select which enemy you would like to play against first by clicking on them - they will move down to the "defender" area.

Next, you use the "attack" button.  The enemy character's health will be deducted by your attack power, and vice versa.  Note that your character's attack power will incremement by its base power with each attack.

If you are defeated by the enemy, the game ends and you can reset.  If you defeat the enemy, then you can choose the next enemy.

Once all enemies are defeated, you have won!
